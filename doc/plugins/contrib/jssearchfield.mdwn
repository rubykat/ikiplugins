IkiWiki::Plugin::jssearchfield - Create a search form to search page field data.

This plugin provides the [[ikiwiki/directive/jssearchfield]] directive.  This
enables one to search the structured data ("field" values) of multiple pages.
This uses Javascript for the searching, which means that the entire thing
is self-contained and does not require a server or CGI access, unlike
the default IkiWiki search. This means that it can be used in places such
as ebook readers.  The disadvantage is that because Javascript runs
in the browser, the searching is only as fast as the machine your browser
is running on.

Because this uses Javascript, the htmlscrubber must be turned off for any page where the directive is used.

This plugin depends on the [[plugins/contrib/field]] plugin.

## Activate the plugin

    # activate the plugin
    add_plugins => [qw{goodstuff field jssearchfield ....}],
